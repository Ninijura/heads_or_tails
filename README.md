Counting heads and tails
========================

A little oCaml command line application to count the number of heads and tails while throwing a coin.

The application first asks you to define the two phrases for different inputs as well as an input to end the counting. It then starts counting your inputs and on exit returns a line stating how many heads and how many tails you've thrown. This can be used to count any series of two different outcomes, but the result will always print "heads" and "tails".
